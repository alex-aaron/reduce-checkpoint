### Week 1 Checkpoint Practice

#### How to test code

To run the test code, make sure your terminal points to the correct directory by typing this into your terminal:

```
cd reduce-checkpoint
```
To actually run the tests, type this into your terminal:

```
npm test
```

Complete the prompts below.

#### Problem 1

Complete the function `over40()` that takes in a parameter of an array of patient objects. This function should use the native reduce method to return the number of patients who are over 40.

#### Problem 2

Complete the function `pencilinAllergy()` that takes in a parameter of an array of patient objects. This function should use the native reduce method to return the number of patients who are allergic to penicilin.

#### Problem 3

Complete the function `patientData()` that takes in a parameter of an array of patient objects. This function should use the native reduce method to return a string of the patients' names separated with a line break.
